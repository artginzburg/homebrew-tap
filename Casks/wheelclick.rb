  # The app updates itself (Sparkle, direct channel only — see ADR 0005), which
  # Homebrew has to be told: without this, `brew upgrade` and the app would each
  # keep installing over the other, and Acceptable Casks asks for the stanza on
  # any cask whose app self-updates. The version above still matters — it is
  # what new installs get, and what `brew upgrade --greedy` compares against.
